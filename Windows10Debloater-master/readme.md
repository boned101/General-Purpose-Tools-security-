just a backup incase one day microsoft nukes this powershell script, 

after all ....

Embrace - Extend - Extinguish is the Microsoft way amiright? 

On a personal note i am seriously thinking of jumping ship to some Linux distro. 
I've had it with these damned windows updates , bloatware and blatant spyware outbound tcp/ip connections to azure servers
and  dont even get me started on the auto-push updates to my msdefender. 

If people at M$ listend to the community , it would have been wonderful, but no $$$ is all they want.
